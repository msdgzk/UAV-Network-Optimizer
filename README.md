# UAV-Network-Optimizer
This project simulates a wireless network including ground-aerial nodes where some nodes act as video streamers or potential interferers. The code provides algorithms to optimize video transmission parameters for maximizing the average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the received video under realistic wireless channel conditions.
